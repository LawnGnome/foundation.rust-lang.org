On Wednesday, November 9th, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a> announced a new open source initiative for nonprofits at their flagship consumer event, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fastlyaltitude2022.com/s/altitude-2022/home">Altitude</a>. The Rust Foundation is excited to be included in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastly.com/fast-forward">Fast Forward</a> program, which will allow the Rust Project to harness Fastly's full-site delivery and powerful Compute@Edge platform at no cost.&nbsp;

Fast Forward is the expansion of Fastly's open source program (launched in 2014), operating as a set of programs designed to "empower and support developers, open source projects, and nonprofits that share \[Fastly's\] vision of an internet that is free, open, and safe for all" according to their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/fast-forward-lets-build-the-good-internet-together">announcement.</a>&nbsp;
