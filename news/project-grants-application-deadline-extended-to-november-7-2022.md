**The Rust Foundation is pleased to share that** **we’ve extended the application deadline for our second round of**[**<u>Project Grants</u>**](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/project-grants/) **to Monday, November 7, 2022 @ 11:59 PM PDT***(6:59 AM UTC on Tuesday, November 7)*. If you were concerned about missing the original Project Grants application deadline of October 31 - or if you've already started or submitted an application - you now have an extra week to create/edit your submission.

As a reminder, [<u>Rust Foundation Project Grants</u>](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/project-grants/) are part of our larger [<u>Community Grants Program</u>](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/). They exist to support dedicated packages of work benefitting the Rust programming language – either through Rust-based coding projects or through education/outreach initiatives. You do **not** need to be a member of a Rust Project Team or a Working Group and you **may** apply as either an individual or as part of a team.&nbsp;

Grants will be awarded in amounts between $2,500 and $15,000 USD.&nbsp;

***Why are we extending the deadline?***

*Our team elected to extend the deadline for this program for several reasons. First, we welcomed two new team members to the Rust Foundation over the past few weeks (*[*<u>Gracie Gregory</u>*](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-10-06-welcome-gracie-gregory-director-of-communications/) *and*[*<u>Sage Griffi</u>*](__notset__)*[n](__notset__)). Since their work directly impacts the administration of the Project Grants Program, we wanted to ensure they had adequate time to focus on making the application period more navigable and visible to the community. Second, we understand that this is a busy time of year for many of you and additional time to apply for grants like ours is always appreciated. Finally, we’re eager to receive as many applications from the Rust community and hope that this extra week enables more of you to both submit and feel as confident as possible in your application\!&nbsp;*

*Thanks for your time and interest in receiving a*[*<u>Rust Foundation Project Grant</u>*](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/project-grants/)*. *
