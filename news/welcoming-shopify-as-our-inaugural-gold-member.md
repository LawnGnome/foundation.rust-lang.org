### We are thrilled to announce that Shopify has joined the Rust Foundation as our first Gold Member\!&nbsp;

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) is a leading provider of essential internet infrastructure for commerce, offering trusted tools to start, grow, market, and manage a retail business of any size. Shopify makes commerce better for everyone with a platform and services that are engineered for reliability while delivering a better shopping experience for consumers everywhere. Shopify is powered by a robust tech stack that includes Rust, making their investment in Rust through the Rust Foundation both timely and relevant.

On their new status as a Rust Foundation Gold Member, Mike Shaver, Distinguished Engineer at Shopify said:

*“Shopify is proud to join the Rust Foundation and support their mission of empowering everyone to build sustainable, efficient, and safe software. Shopify is building a 100-year company, and we are equally committed to our developer community and helping Rust be a 100-year tool that easily scales for everyone who uses it. Powering commerce for millions of merchants requires systems built to scale and perform, and Rust is a big part of Shopify’s strategy for building those systems. Becoming part of the Rust Foundation supports Rust’s growth, as well as the Rust community and ecosystem.”&nbsp;*
