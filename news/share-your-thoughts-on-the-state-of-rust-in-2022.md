### It’s that time of year again\! The latest <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/12/05/survey-launch.html">State of Rust Survey</a> is open through <s>December 19 </s>December 26, 2022 – and the Rust Foundation encourages you to take part in it.&nbsp;

For those who aren’t familiar, this short survey conducted by the Rust Project is used to surface input and perspectives from both current and prospective Rust users and those who follow the language. The valuable information gathered from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/12/05/survey-launch.html">State of Rust</a> survey helps Project leaders better understand the evolution of the language and identify challenges respondents might be encountering. This feedback is then used to inform Project priorities and strategies for 2023.

### **Who should take the State of Rust Survey?**

The Rust Project is seeking feedback from anyone who is actively interested in the future of Rust. In addition to Rust programmers, this includes those interested in the language, technical managers, and executives who are considering implementing Rust at their organization.

### **Who runs the State of Rust Survey?**

This survey is run and overseen by the Rust Project. As the organization stewarding the Rust language, the Rust Foundation supports the efforts of the Project, which is responsible for the design and analysis of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/12/05/survey-launch.html">State of Rust Survey</a>.

We’re thankful for the hard work of the Rust Project’s survey team in creating and running the survey, and we look forward to seeing how the responses shape their strategic planning going forward.
