1. All new inbound code contributions to projects maintained by the Rust Foundation shall be dual-licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and the MIT License (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT) (together, the “Project Licenses”).
2. All outbound code will be made available under the Project Licenses.
3. The license for all upstream dependencies of a project shall be consistent with the project’s outbound license.
4. All documentation and media content will be contributed to and made available by the Rust Foundation under an appropriate open license, including but not limited to the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode), the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode), Apache License Version 2.0, and/or the MIT License.
5. If an alternative inbound or outbound license is required for compliance with the license of an upstream open source project, or otherwise to advance the Rust Foundation’s mission, the Board may approve the use of alternative licenses for inbound or outbound contributions to particular projects on a case-by-base basis, excluding projects that comprise the Rust compiler and toolchain.&nbsp;
6. All pre-existing projects evaluated for contribution to the Rust Foundation shall be licensed in their entirety under one or more open source licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative. If the license for a contributed project is not one of the Project Licenses, Board approval shall be required.
7. When a pre-existing project is contributed to the Rust Foundation, ownership of its trademark and logo assets must also be transferred to the Rust Foundation.
